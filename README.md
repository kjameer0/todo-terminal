# Design doc

I want a cool dashboard that allows me to see all of my tasks in a visually appealing way that's easy to navigate. The idea in the long run is to give it the digital apocalypse aesthetic. I want the task list to be editable and manipulate it in real time. I think the tasks should always be displayed, and then the various commands should open up the menu. So when I am on the default screen I want to see the screen

I want to move more in the direction of a task automater/manager.
 people should be able to view comprehensive details about their tasks and keep day over day notes with them. They should also be able to activate a workspace for their app.


I want to emphasize ease of use. I already have an app to manage tasks. but i want the following features:
1. context log: I can see what brought me to the current place in my task. Notes are related to the context of the task.
2. A task can be made up of subtasks, but there is a global context pool per task
   1. a task can be incomplete or complete
   2. a task can be marked complete even if it's subtasks are not marked complete
3. a task has a workspace associated with it
   1. Create
   2. Read
   3. Update
   4. Destroy
   5. open workspace to pick up where i left off
4. There
